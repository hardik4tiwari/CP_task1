A total of $$$n$$$ applicants submitted the tasks. The Performance of the Applicants has been auto-graded by a suitable Testing Software ,but the Coordinators (Divyansh ,Burhanuddin ,Hardik ,Yash ) are unhappy with the Raw Scores and decide to regrade the performance. But the Problem is there are too many tasks to grade ,so the Coordinators come up with an idea to ease the process.</P><P>The 4 Coordinators decide to grade equal number of applicants. Each Coordinator has a Grading Strictness $$$a_i$$$ . If a coordinator with Grading Strictness $$$a_i$$$ grades a particular Applicant (raw score &mdash; $$$b_j $$$) ,then his final score is $$$b_j/a_i$$$. An applicant can qualify for the the secretary interview if his/her $$$ final score \geq k $$$.</P><P>The Coordinators want to know the minimum number of Applicants that could be called for Secretary Interviews.</P><P>It is Guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is a multiple of 4.</P></DIV><P></P><P></P><DIV class="input-specification"><DIV class="section-title">Input</DIV><P></P><P>Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 10^4)$$$ &mdash; the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</P><P>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5)$$$ &mdash; the length of the array $$$b$$$(The number of Applicants) and $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5})$$$ &mdash; the final qualifying score.</P><P>The second line of each test case contains $$$4$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$$$ $$$(1 \leq a_i &lt; 10^{9})$$$ &mdash; the grading strictness of the Coordinators (Divyansh, Hardik, Burhanuddin, Yash).</P><P>The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ $$$(0 \leq b_i &lt; 10^{18})$$$ &mdash; the raw scores of the Applicants.</P><P>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \times 10^5$$$.</P></DIV><P></P><P></P><DIV class="output-specification"><DIV class="section-title">Output</DIV><P></P><P>For each test case, print one integer &mdash; the minimum number of applicants called for Interview.</P></DIV><P></P><P></P><DIV class="note"><DIV class="section-title">Note</DIV><P></P><P>Example: $$$n=12$$$ $$$k=3$$$</P><P>$$$a_1 = 1$$$ $$$a_2=2$$$ $$$a_3=3$$$ $$$a_4=4$$$</P><P>$$$b={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}$$$</P><P>In this example ,</P><P>$$$a_1$$$ can take applicant with scores {1,2,12}</P><P>$$$a_2$$$ can take applicant with scores {3,4,5}</P><P>$$$a_3$$$ can take applicant with scores {6,7,8}</P><P>$$$a_4$$$ can take applicant with scores {9,10,11}</P><P>so their final scores will be {1,2,12},{1.5,2,2.5},{2,2.33,2.67},{2.25,2.5,2.75} only one applicant has final score greater than 3, Therefore, Minimum number of applicants called for interview $$$=$$$1</P></DIV></DIV><P></P><P>  </P>
